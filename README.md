# Coordination of CcpA and CodY regulators in Staphylococcus aureus USA300 strains

This repository contains code used to build the model and run the analysis for the manuscript "Coordination of CcpA and CodY regulators in Staphylococcus aureus USA300 strains." The `GenerateFigures.ipynb` contains all the code needed to regenerate the figures from the paper which are saved in `PaperFigs`. The `Paperdata` folder contains the data required for the figures.

The ICA model was built using the five steps in the modulome-workflow. The code for each of the step are in the `modulome-workflow` folder. Additionally, the `modulome-workflow` folder also contains `data` folder which has all the raw, interim and processed data used/generated during the model building process.
